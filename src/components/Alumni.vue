                                    “Growing up, I always knew I wanted to venture into a career that involved applying Mathematics in the real world. I was not only good at Mathematics, but I loved and enjoyed it. Most people do not get excited about numbers and formulas as they see them as difficult concepts to understand. But it was easy-peasy for me!

After completing my secondary education, I began searching for courses that were in line with my dream.  Studying Actuarial Science at Strathmore University was my destination. I enrolled in the year 2014, and graduated with a First Class Honors in Bachelor of Business Science, Actuarial Science in the year 2018.

LIFE AS AN ACTUARIAL SCIENCE STUDENT

Actuarial Science is a course where one acquires the skill and knowledge to use mathematics, statistics and probability principles to evaluate risks and maintain the economic stability of insurance in anticipation of future events. It sounds technical, but it was amazing to see how this plays out in the professional world other than using case studies to grasp the concepts.

Even though the name may sound intimidating, it is not difficult to pursue and ace the examinations. “A dream does not become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work”. Being an Actuarial Science student calls for commitment and dedication while pursuing it. Hours on end of continuous learning was not a joke but I knew my end goal. There were nights I would sleep late burning the midnight oil in order to catch up on my notes. I had to cancel enjoyment to put in extra study hours.  It needed a lot of dedication and commitment to ace the examinations. Practice, practice makes perfect. It’s the only way the concepts stick, make sense and evolve. Keep in mind, nothing is impossible as the word itself says ‘I’m possible’!

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much
“Group work.” A phrase that students often express sentiments that they do not look forward to when the lecturer hands out assignments and to desire to prioritize individuality over the group. It’s no secret that group assignments provide a unique opportunity for us to learn about teamwork, enhance our analytical abilities and help us develop interpersonal skills. However, on the flip side, group work can be tiring and unfair as some bandwagon only to reap off the good grades instead of actually participating in the assignment.

Throughout my journey, I surrounded myself with intelligent and diverse people who speak the same “math language,” and with whom we shared knowledge and learnt from each other through our interactions. Looking back, I am appreciative of my lecturers who encouraged us to do group work and as a result , I am able to interact with my colleagues and network with ease in my career field. “Being successful doesn’t necessarily make you great. What makes you great is when you reach back and help somebody else become great.” – Joel Osteen

Hard work betrays none/much effort equates to much prosperity
The journey to success was never easy… but there is always a satisfaction when the job done well has been recognized. In almost all semesters, my name appeared on the Dean’s list and this definitely pushed me to unlock my ultimate potential.

But what stood out the most for me was receiving the “Heart of Gold” award upon completion of my four-year journey from my fellow mates and lecturers. This just made me realize that I have touched many hearts by just being myself and doing the normal things. You never know when you make a difference to someone else’s life so keep spreading positivity in this journey called ‘Life’.

Pick up that brochure and learn!
Somewhat surprisingly, many university students question why they should attend a career fair. They would rather look for job opportunities online. Whilst that is a viable option, one misses out on the opportunity to network with your potential employer in your desired industry and also, attend free workshops. Strathmore University provided numerous opportunities where I met dozens of employers seeking to offer jobs. I am indebted to the Career Services for sending us career opportunities emails that kept us in the loop while we searched for a place to chart our path in achieving our goals and dreams.

Life after campus working at Ernst & Young Global Limited (EY)
My experience as an Actuarial Science student, along with being an actuary at the Ernst & Young Global Limited (EY), where I work as a senior Actuarial Risk Consultant, has helped fuel my love of Actuarial Science. EY, being a consulting firm, has given me a diversified experience not only in the technical actuarial space but in building my soft skills as well.

Entering into the professional world is a rollercoaster ride with many ups and downs. I wouldn’t say that it was an easy cake walk but I learnt how to believe in my talents, abilities and more importantly, value time. Learning something new every day will become the norm of your life. My advice to anyone entering the professional world is to be prepared to grasp any knowledge opportunities that come your way and have an open mindset at all times as it will accelerate your growth in regards to your career journey. The network you build in your professional workspace will also make your journey much simpler.

Disconnect to reconnect
Reading books and novels were my escape when I needed a break from my actuarial science notebooks. I enjoy how books feed and arouse your curiosity, inviting you into their amazing world full of characters, places, and stories you have never dreamed of. They say reading a book is taking a trip without a passport. Through painting and art therapy, I was able to switch off from the stressful world.

Lifelong lessons
Strathmore University has left a mark in my life that I am indebted to them forever. Funny thing is, you only realize the impact after you have left.

Values. Knowledge. Opportunities. You name it, many doors have been opened and I have experienced it all. I would like to thank the University for giving me a chance to grow. I will cherish that forever.

To you, reading this article…
Follow your dreams. Do not doubt yourself, because you got this! You’re capable of doing exceedingly well!

                                    On Friday, the 22nd of September, 2023, Rodgers Githinji came back to Strathmore to have a chat with first year students at the Strathmore Law School. A trailblazer and a role model worth emulating, his insights captivated the students who attended the first of the SLS Alumni guest speaker series. In an interesting and practical interaction, Rodgers shared his experiences on good use of time, how to handle rejection, being daring and ambitious, and much more.
                                    In his introduction and his Strathmore experience he had this to say:
By the time I sat my first semester I didn’t even know how AMS works; while I am not proud of it, I am glad I eventually picked up the pace and managed to maintain it through the years.

In order to distance myself  from bad company, I dedicated all my free time to productive endeavors. I enrolled for an evening course and by the time I graduated, I had a Diploma in Business Management and a CIM diploma. I also started a YouTube channel dubbed Nairobi Legal Insights. I can confidently affirm that my career started on YouTube, where I used to and still educate non-lawyers on contract law.
Responding to a question on how to make good use of time and what clubs he  joined while at Strathmore, he said:
Most humans tend to be generally lazy, so dedicating an extra thirty minutes every day to a worthwhile venture sets you apart from the majority. Consider opening a LinkedIn profile and proactively develop it in readiness for the job market; authenticity in your experiences is crucial. Be intentional on the companies and connections you engage with. Success is access to information. Don’t ask for jobs on LinkedIn. Build your brand and create relationships. Relationships are organic, take time to build them.

Use your social media platforms to build yourself and your profile, take advantage of LinkedIn especially. Be mindful of what you post on your social pages; avoid excessive focus on  your private life. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have fun, by all means do but try to strike a balance between your social life and the school work. Keep in mind that every online post contributes to a lasting digital footprint. Therefore, limit the personal information you post on your social media platforms, unless it relates to your career. Be mindful of your online presence as your social media content can influence your job applications, either securing you a job or earning you a rejection.

Equally, it is  important to take advantage of the events that are held at Strathmore.   Please attend the events at the auditorium. They tend to bring good industry connections, yet as students we fail to take advantage and engage with them when they are readily accessible on campus.

At the same time, please remember to develop great soft skills, maintain a positive social media presence, and cultivate respect for others. These qualities can significantly expand your horizons and unlock unforeseen opportunities. Value your time, use it efficiently and foster an independent mindset.

Another student asked him; how do you handle failure and rejection?
As you transition, you will face failure and rejection. It’s part of life. If you don’t apply and put yourself out there nobody will know about you. Don’t be afraid of trying and failing; if you don’t try, you have already failed. If you never speak about yourself, nobody will know about what you are doing.  Sell your skills. Your work must show itself. Rejection only helps you get better at it. It builds your confidence and resilience.

I keep a rejection folder. One of the first rejections that I received was  from Strathmore University when I applied to be a graduate assistant in 2020. Since then, I have faced many rejections along the way. It’s never been an easy journey since I tend to be daring and I am not afraid to apply for opportunities that are beyond my reach. But I believe that if you are consistent, you can achieve your dream. In today’s market, the demand is for the exceptional, the outstanding. For you to reach that level, you must excel in fundamental aspects. Leverage the insights provided by your lecturers to build networks and pave your way towards a successful career.

Learn from your mistakes and keep upping your skill. Separate rejection from yourself; it’s not about you, it’s about your skills and how you present them. We leave SLS thinking that you are going to make quick money. The reality is different; be open to start at unpaid internships. A great internship can be  good training for the job and the market. It opens a door, helps you build networks and puts you ahead of the rest in case there is a job opening. Don’t let your best grades e limit your career options.  Think beyond traditional law firms and open your minds and skills to the many and varied sectors of our economy.
He concluded by saying:
What people see as the end product has a great story behind it. Life is about giving and taking. Ask for help and be persistent. Your top three friends are going to either make you or break you. They can help keep you in check. At SLS, you are receiving the best education you can.
